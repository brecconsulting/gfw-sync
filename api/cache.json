(2012) to generate a pan-tropical map of aboveground live woody biomass density at 30 m resolution for circa the year 2000. Along with the carbon density values, there is an error map at the same spatial resolution providing the uncertainty in aboveground carbon density estimation. These maps allow for the co-location of biomass estimates with Hansen et al. (2013, v1.0) tree cover loss estimates at similar spatial resolution. The statistical relationship derived between ground-based measurements of forest biomass density and co-located Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR waveform metrics as described by Baccini et al. (2012) were used to estimate the biomass density of more than 40,000 GLAS footprints throughout the tropics. Then, using randomForest models, the GLAS-derived estimates of biomass density were correlated to continuous, gridded variables including Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and products (e.g., reflectance), elevation, and biophysical variables. By using continuous gridded datasets as inputs to the randomForest models, a wall-to-wall 30 m resolution map of aboveground woody biomass density across the tropics was produced as well as the associated uncertainty layer. The uncertainty layer takes into account the errors from allometric equations, LiDAR based model, and randomForest model. All the errors are propagated to the final biomass estimate.

The first step was a per-pixel classification of areas with tree canopy cover of 30% and above for the 2000 reference year. A second per-pixel classification procedure was performed to separate primary forest from other tree cover for 2000; contiguous areas of 5 ha and greater were retained as primary forest. A limited editing of this classification was performed to remove older plantations and adjust other forest formations that could not be identified using the per-pixel classifier, but could be identified in photo-interpretive contexts. Primary forests were subsequently characterized into primary intact and primary degraded subclasses using the GIS-based buffering approach of the Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL). To create the IFL layer, buffers of roads, settlements and other signs of human landscape alteration were used to identify degraded areas within zones of primary forest cover. IFL mapping employed cloud-free Landsat mosaics to quantify changes in primary intact forest extent. The map of primary intact and primary degraded forest cover types corresponds to the Indonesia Ministry of Forestry’s primary and secondary forest cover types.</p>", "translated_function": "", "title": "Indonesia primary forests", "date_of_content": "<p>2000</p>", "translated_overview": "", "learn_more": "", "source": "<p>Margono, B.A., P.V.

PRODES historically used Landsat 5 images, but now also incorporates imagery from Landsat 7 and 8, CBERS-2, CBERS-2B, Resourcesat-1, and UK2-DMC.

The PRODES system uses the seasonal year, starting on August 1st, to calculate annual deforestation, so images are selected as near to this date as possible (generally from July, August, and September). From 2003 to 2005, analysts used image transformation to determine the components of vegetation, soil, and shadow using the program SPRING. These components were segmented and classified into the classes of forest, non-forest, deforestation in the target year, previous deforestation, clouds, and water, which are then manually corrected by experts. Starting in 2005, a new methodology was implemented which makes use of the open source TerraAmazon platform. The platform allows the PRODES analysis to be more uniform and can incorporate imagery from a variety of satellites. As before, images are selected to be as cloud free as possible. The images are then masked to exclude non-forest, previous deforestation, and water using the previous year’s analysis.

In 2008, the Royal Government of Cambodia adopted the <a href=\"http://www.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/pdf-viewer/?pdf=download/law/Law%20on%20Natural%20Protected%20Areas_February_15_2008_Khm.pdf\">Law on Protected Areas</a> introducing and defining a new zoning system to manage the protected areas in Cambodia.</p><p>The law, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment, underlines the expansion and modification of protected areas categories which additionally include the Ramsar sites, biosphere reserves, natural heritage sites and marine parks. Since the Protected Areas Law was passed, numerous sub-decrees have been passed classifying areas as Sustainable Use Zones (degazettement). According to the law, after consulting with relevant ministries and institutions, local authorities, and local communities, the Government may permit development and investment activities in these zones. These activities can include infrastructure development, including irrigation and hydroelectricity projects, mining and resin exploitation.</p><p>This dataset contains data for five types of protected areas in Cambodia (national park, wildlife sanctuary, protected landscape, multiple use, Ramsar site) with issuing dates starting from 1993 to 2014. Data for biosphere reserves, national heritage sites, and marine parks is currently not available on ODC. Due to the lack of publicly available spatial information on zoning and degazettement of protected areas, this dataset does not include information on adjustments.</p><p>Open Development Cambodia collected the data from a variety of public domain sources such as the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutes, company websites, and news reports.</p>", "translated_function": "", "title": "Cambodia protected areas", "date_of_content": "<p>1993-2014</p>", "translated_overview": "", "learn_more": "", "source": "<p><a href=\"https://cambodia.opendevelopmentmekong.net/\">Open Development Cambodia</a></p>", "other": "", "download_data": "https://data.opendevelopmentmekong.net/dataset/protected_areas?type=dataset", "translated_title": "", "resolution": "", "frequency_of_updates": ""}, "usa_land_cover_change": {"function": "<p>This layer displays change in land cover between 2001 and 2011.

Strict Nature Reserves.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation. Other common designations: Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve</p></li><br><li><p><strong>Ib. Wilderness Areas.</strong> Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments. Other common designations: Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area</p></li><br><li><p><strong>II. National Parks.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation. Other common designations: State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park</p></li><br><li><p><strong>III. National Monuments or Features.</strong> Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic. Other common designations: Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden</p></li><br><li><p><strong>IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas.</strong> Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat. Other common designations: National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary</p></li><br><li><p><strong>V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes.</strong> Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan. Other common designations: National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area</p></li><br><li><p><strong>VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.</strong> Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition.

Over 35 times the size of Singapore, this majestic and ancient ecosystem covers more than 2.6 million hectares of lowland rainforests, peat swamps, montane and coastal forests and alpine meadows. Globally recognized as one of the richest expanses of tropical rainforest found anywhere in Southeast Asia, the Leuser Ecosystem is also one of Asia’s largest carbon sinks. The Leuser Ecosystem is the last place on earth where orangutans, rhinos, elephants, and tigers co-exist in the wild. All four of these species are now classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as Critically Endangered. The Leuser Ecosystem is the only remaining habitat left in Sumatra large enough to sustain viable populations of these species. A publication in leading international journal Science listed the Leuser Ecosystem as “one of the world’s foremost irreplaceable areas.”</p><p>The Leuser Ecosystem is an essential asset for the economic development of Aceh, providing a total economic value of at least 350 million US dollars per year. The Leuser Ecosystem acts as a life-support system for approximately four million people in Aceh. The primary ecosystem services are fresh water provision and disaster mitigation. The forests of the Leuser Ecosystem act as a sponge, soaking up the downpours of the rainy season and spreading out the release of water downstream more evenly across the months. Deforestation of this environmentally sensitive area is having a dramatic impact by increasing the damage caused by flooding and landslides, and causing economic damage to communities and downstream industry. Locally and globally, the Leuser Ecosystem also has immense environmental value due to its role in climate regulation and carbon storage. Efforts to conserve the Leuser Ecosystem date as far back as the early 19th century, when the traditional leaders of Aceh lobbied the colonial government to protect their natural heritage, ranging from the mountains all the way down to the coast. More recent laws have served to strengthen the protection of the Leuser Ecosystem and placed the responsibility for managing its protection and restoration with the Aceh Provincial Government (Article 150 of National Law on Governing Aceh No. 11/2006). Furthermore, the Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh has special legal status as a National Strategic Area for its Environmental Protection Function (26 of 2007 juncto 26/2008), prohibiting any activities that reduce that function, including cultivation and infrastructure development.</p>", "translated_function": "", "title": "Indonesia Leuser Ecosystem", "date_of_content": "<p>November 19, 2013</p>", "translated_overview": "", "learn_more": "", "source": "<p>Hutan Alam dan Lingkungan Aceh (HAkA)</p>", "other": "", "download_data": "http://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/16dae98167264b8abfbd13e23802e4f3_0", "translated_title": "", "resolution": "", "frequency_of_updates": ""}, "tree_cover_loss": {"function": "<p>Identifies areas of gross tree cover loss </p>", "geographic_coverage": "<p>Global land area (excluding Antarctica and other Arctic islands) </p>", "cautions": "<p>In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. “Loss” indicates the removal or mortality of tree cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage.

The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM), the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. Over 1 million satellite images were processed and analyzed, including over 600,000 Landsat 7 images for the 2000-2012 interval, and approximately 400,000 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images for updates for the 2011-2014 interval. The clear land surface observations in the satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was applied to identify per pixel tree cover loss.</p><p>In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. Tree cover loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale. Tree cover loss may be the result of human activities, including forestry practices such as timber harvesting or deforestation (the conversion of natural forest to other land uses), as well as natural causes such as disease or storm damage. Fire is another widespread cause of tree cover loss, and can be either natural or human-induced.</p><p>This data set has been updated twice since its creation, and now includes loss up to 2014 (Version 1.2). The analysis method has been modified in numerous ways, including new data for the target year, re-processed data for the previous two years (2011 and 2012 for the Version 1.1 update, 2012 and 2013 for the Version 1.2 update), and improved modelling and calibration. These modifications improve change detection for 2011-2014, including better detection of boreal loss due to fire, smallholder rotation agriculture in tropical forests, selective losing, and short cycle plantations. Eventually, a future “Version 2.0” will include reprocessing for 2000-2010 data, but in the meantime integrated use of the original data and Version 1.2 should be performed with caution.

Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher concentration of tree cover loss, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower concentration of tree cover loss. There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is at full resolution (≥ zoom level 13).</p><p>The tree cover canopy density of the displayed data varies according to the selection - use the legend on the map to change the minimum tree cover canopy density threshold.</p>", "translated_function": "", "title": "Tree cover loss ", "date_of_content": "<p>2001-2014</p>", "translated_overview": "", "learn_more": "http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850", "source": "<p>Hansen, M.
